    Given a list of different interval lengths and the indices of
    interest in that list, weight the probability that we will sample
    one of the indices in `indices` based on the interval lengths in
    that sublist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interval_lengths : list(int)
        The list of lengths of intervals that we will draw from. This is
        used to weight the indices proportionally to interval length.
    indices : list(int)
