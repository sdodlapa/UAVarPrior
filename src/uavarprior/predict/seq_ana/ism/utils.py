    """
    Creates a list containing each mutation that occurs from an
    *in silico* mutagenesis across the whole sequence.

    Please note that we have not parallelized this function yet, so
    runtime increases exponentially when you increase `nMutBase`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : str
        A string containing the sequence we would like to mutate.
    nMutBase : int, optional
        Default is 1. The number of base changes to make with each set of
        mutations evaluated, e.g. `nMutBase = 2` considers all
        pairs of SNPs.
    refSeq : class, optional
        Default is `fugep.sequences.Genome`. The type of sequence
        that has been passed in.
    startPosition : int, optional
        Default is 0. The starting position of the subsequence to be
        mutated.
    endPosition : int or None, optional
        Default is None. The ending position of the subsequence to be
        mutated. If left as `None`, then `len(sequence)` will be
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    list(list(tuple))
        A list of all possible mutations. Each element in the list is
        itself a list of tuples, e.g. element = [(0, 'T')] when only mutating
        1 base at a time. Each tuple is the position to mutate and the base
        with which we are replacing the reference base.

        For a sequence of length 1000, mutating 1 base at a time means that
        we return a list with length of 3000-4000, depending on the number of
        unknown bases in the input sequences.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the value of `startPosition` or `endPosition` is negative.
    ValueError
        If there are fewer than `nMutBase` between `startPosition`
        and `endPosition`.
    ValueError
        If `startPosition` is greater or equal to `endPosition`.
    ValueError
        If `startPosition` is not less than `len(sequence)`.
    ValueError
        If `endPosition` is greater than `len(sequence)`.
