# UAVarPrior: Uncertainty-Aware Variational Prior

UAVarPrior is a framework for incorporating uncertainty-aware variational priors into machine learning models. This approach provides robust uncertainty quantification while maintaining predictive performance.

## Features

- **Variational Prior Integration**: Leverage probabilistic modeling with variational priors
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Capture and quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based configuration for reproducible experiments
- **Command-line Interface**: Intuitive CLI for training, evaluation, and inference
- **Modern Model Architecture**: Clean abstraction between model interfaces and implementations

## üîó Multi-Account Repository Access

This repository is synchronized across multiple GitHub accounts for enhanced collaboration and backup:

- **Primary**: [SanjeevaRDodlapati/UAVarPrior](https://github.com/SanjeevaRDodlapati/UAVarPrior)
- **Mirror 1**: [sdodlapati3/UAVarPrior](https://github.com/sdodlapati3/UAVarPrior)
- **Mirror 2**: [sdodlapa/UAVarPrior](https://github.com/sdodlapa/UAVarPrior)

All repositories are kept in perfect sync. Clone from any account you have access to.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone from any of the synchronized repositories
git clone git@github.com:SanjeevaRDodlapati/UAVarPrior.git
# OR: git clone git@github.com:sdodlapati3/UAVarPrior.git
# OR: git clone git@github.com:sdodlapa/UAVarPrior.git
cd UAVarPrior

# Regular installation
pip install -e .

# For development (installs development dependencies)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Migration from Legacy Version

If you're migrating from an older version of UAVarPrior, run the cleanup script first:

```bash
python scripts/clean_installation.py
```

This script will clean up old installation files to avoid conflicts.

## Quick Start

### Training a Model

1. Create a configuration file (see examples in `config_examples/`)
2. Run the training command:

```bash
uavarprior run config_examples/example_config.yml
```

### Validating a Configuration

Before running a full training job, you can validate your configuration:

```bash
uavarprior validate config_examples/example_config.yml
```

For more thorough validation including model initialization:

```bash
uavarprior validate config_examples/example_config.yml --dry-run
```

### Debugging a Configuration

If you're having issues with your configuration, use the debug command:

```bash
uavarprior debug-config config_examples/example_config.yml
```

## Configuration Guide

UAVarPrior uses YAML configuration files to define models, datasets, and operations. See [CONFIG_GUIDE.md](CONFIG_GUIDE.md) for detailed information on configuration structure and options.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# Operations to perform
ops:
  - train
  - evaluate

# Output directory
output_dir: ./outputs/example_run

# Model configuration
model:
  class: SimpleConvModel
  classArgs:
    input_channels: 4
    conv_channels: [16, 32, 64]
    kernel_size: 3
    pool_size: 2
    dropout: 0.2
    linear_features: [128, 64]
    output_features: 1

# Data configuration
data:
  dataset_class: uavarprior.data.sequences.SequenceDataset
  batch_size: 64
  train_args:
    data_path: ./data/training_data.h5
    split: train
  val_args:
    data_path: ./data/validation_data.h5
    split: val

# Training configuration
training:
  epochs: 10
  lr: 0.001
```

## Model Implementation

UAVarPrior provides a clean interface for implementing models. To create a custom model:

1. Create a PyTorch model class (nn.Module)
2. Implement the required factory functions: `get_model()`, `criterion()`, and `get_optimizer()`
3. Use your model in the configuration file

See [the example model](uavarprior/model/nn/simple_conv_model.py) for a complete implementation.

## Large Files Handling

This repository uses `.gitignore` to exclude large files that exceed GitHub's 100MB limit. Key large files are stored in designated `outputs` directories that are not tracked by Git.

### Locations for Large Files

- **Data Files**: Large data files should be stored in `uavarprior/data/outputs/`
- **Model Weights**: Large model files should be stored in `uavarprior/model/outputs/`
- **Analysis Results**: Large analysis files (like pickle files) should be stored in `uavarprior/interpret/outputs/`

## Utility Scripts

UAVarPrior includes several utility scripts to help with common tasks:

- **verify_model.py**: Verify that a model can be loaded and used
- **test_config.py**: Test a configuration file for validity

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules:

- **data**: For data processing and management
- **model**: For model definitions and training
- **interpret**: For result analysis and interpretation
- **analysis**: For analyzing model predictions

Each module has a `docs` directory with documentation and an `outputs` directory for large files.

## üöÄ Multi-Account Development Workflow

### For Contributors and Maintainers

This repository uses an advanced multi-account synchronization system for enhanced collaboration:

#### Quick Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

# 2. Push to all accounts simultaneously (if you have maintainer access)
./push_all.csh

# 3. Your changes are now live on all three GitHub accounts!
```

#### Setting Up Multi-Account Access (Maintainers Only)

If you're a maintainer with access to multiple accounts:

```bash
# The repository includes automated push scripts
# Individual repo push: ./push_all.csh (pushes to all 3 accounts)
# Global push: ~/push_all_repos.csh (pushes all genomic repos)
```

#### For External Contributors

```bash
# Fork any of the synchronized repositories
# Work on your fork normally
# Submit PRs to the primary repository (SanjeevaRDodlapati/UAVarPrior)
```

### Repository Synchronization Details

- **Automatic Sync**: All commits are automatically synchronized across accounts
- **Branch Consistency**: All repositories use `main` as the primary branch
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes appear on all accounts within seconds
- **Admin Access**: Full administrative privileges across all synchronized accounts

### üîß SSH Authentication Setup

For seamless multi-account access, maintainers use SSH key-based authentication:

```bash
# Test connections (maintainers only)
ssh -T github-sanjeevar    # Tests SanjeevaRDodlapati access
ssh -T github-sdodlapati3  # Tests sdodlapati3 access  
ssh -T github-sdodlapa     # Tests sdodlapa access
```

### ü§ù Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Pull Requests**: Submit PRs to the primary repository (SanjeevaRDodlapati)
2. **Issues**: Report issues on any of the synchronized repositories
3. **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions on the primary repository
4. **Releases**: Releases are synchronized across all accounts

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Branch Protection

All repositories have branch protection enabled:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Prevent direct pushes to `main` (except for maintainers)
- Automatic security scanning and dependency alerts
- Protection against large file uploads and force pushes

### üìä Repository Health

- **CI/CD**: Automated testing via GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting checks
- **Security**: Dependabot alerts and vulnerability scanning
- **Documentation**: Automatically updated across all accounts
